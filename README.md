The Vulnerable API (Based on OpenAPI 3) vampi



VAmPI is a vulnerable API made with Flask and it includes vulnerabilities from the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for APIs. It was created as I wanted a vulnerable API to evaluate the efficiency of tools used to detect security issues in APIs. It includes a switch on/off to allow the API to be vulnerable or not while testing. This allows to cover better the cases for false positives/negatives. VAmPI can also be used for learning/teaching purposes. You can find a bit more details about the vulnerabilities in erev0s.com.
Features

    Based on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for APIs.
    OpenAPI3 specs and Postman Collection included.
    Global switch on/off to have a vulnerable environment or not.
    Token-Based Authentication (Adjust lifetime from within app.py)

VAmPI's flow of actions is going like this: an unregistered user can see minimal information about the dummy users included in the API. A user can register and then login to be allowed using the token received during login to post a book. For a book posted the data accepted are the title and a secret about that book. Each book is unique for every user and only the owner of the book should be allowed to view the secret.

A quick rundown of the actions included can be seen in the following table:
Action 	Path 	Details
GET 	/createdb 	Creates and populates the database with dummy data
GET 	/ 	VAmPI home
GET 	/users/v1 	Displays all users with basic information
GET 	/users/v1/_debug 	Displays all details for all users
POST 	/users/v1/register 	Register new user
POST 	/users/v1/login 	Login to VAmPI
GET 	/users/v1/{username} 	Displays user by username
DELETE 	/users/v1/{username} 	Deletes user by username (Only Admins)
PUT 	/users/v1/{username}/email 	Update a single users email
PUT 	/users/v1/{username}/password 	Update users password
GET 	/books/v1 	Retrieves all books
POST 	/books/v1 	Add new book
GET 	/books/v1/{book} 	Retrieves book by title along with secret

For more details you can use a service like the swagger editor supplying it the OpenAPI specification which can be found in the directory openapi_specs.
